# Planet

Planet is a containerized Kubernetes environment, it is a self-containerizing Ubuntu 15.04 image with
Kubernetes services running inside. 

There are [official ways](http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/docs/getting-started-guides/README.html) to install and 
play with Kubernetes, but `Planet` differs from those because:

* Planet creates a "bubble of consistency" for every Kubernetes cluster we deploy.
* Planet allows to packge our own services running under/alongside Kubernetes.
* Planet facilitates easier remote updating of itself and for Kubernetes (because it uses [Orbit containers](https://github.com/gravitational/orbit))

It also happens to be a great way to play with Kubernetes!
Also check out the [developer documentation](docs/README.md).

## Installation

Planet images are distributed to remote sites via [Gravitational Orbit](https://github.com/gravitational/orbit/blob/master/README.md).

Orbit is a package manager that helps to distribute arbitrary files, with versioning, 
across many Linux clusters (like AWS accounts). Planet tarball already contains Orbit manifest, 
which makes it an Orbit package.

We have an `Orbit` repository running on AWS. It is actually the easiest (and recommended) way to 
install Planet. To see which builds/versions are available, run:

`orbit list-remote -m http://notary-1916887043.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:4443 planet-dev`

To install:

```
orbit -m "http://notary-1916887043.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:4443" \
      -r "http://registry-1284667016.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:5000" \
      pull planet-dev:0.0.14
```

Verify that you have it:

```
> orbit list
* planet-dev:0.0.14
```

## Start Planet

Planet needs a site-specific configuration to run. Orbit allows users to specify configuration as 
key-value pairs and store it as another, _site-local_ package. This allows independent upgrades of 
packages and their configuration.

Configure planet package (`planet-dev:0.0.1`) and store the output as a _local configuration package_ `planet-cfg:0.0.1`

```bash
orbit configure planet-dev:0.0.1 \
    planet-cfg:0.0.1 args\
    --role=master --role=node\
    --volume=/var/planet/etcd:/ext/etcd\
    --volume=/var/planet/registry:/ext/registry\
    --volume=/var/planet/docker:/ext/docker
```

This command will execute `start` command supplied by `planet/dev:0.0.1` and will use configuration from `planet/cfg:0.0.1` that we've just generated

```bash
orbit exec-config start planet/dev:0.0.1 planet/cfg:0.0.1
```

## Other Commands

Planet is a generic `container image`. It is basically tarballed and gzipped rootfs.
Usually these images are distributed and updated by [Orbit](https://github.com/gravitational/orbit).

Inside a container image there are Kubernetes components and the Planet binary in `rootfs/usr/bin/planet`.
When you launch that binary, it will self-containerize within its RootFS and will launch all Kubernetes
components using systemd.

If you start it without any commands, it will show the usage info:

```
Commands:
  help   [<command>...]               Show help.
  start  [<flags>] [<rootfs>]         Start orbit container
  stop   [<rootfs>]                   Stop the container
  enter  [<flags>] [<rootfs>] [<cmd>] Enter running the container
  status [<rootfs>]                   Get status of a running container
```

Here's how to stop Planet, for example:

```bash
orbit exec-config stop planet/dev:0.0.1 planet/cfg:0.0.1
```

## Hacking on Planet

The section below is for developers who want to make changes to `Planet`.

### Building (installing from source)

**IMPORTANT** the build process relies on Docker > 1.6.2. When installing Docker on Virtualbox/vagrant you may 
end up with a VM which doesn't boot (hangs during shared volume mounting). Do `apt-get dist-upgrade` to fix that.

Also, if using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), make sure you have Vagrant version `1.7.4` or newer. This building process has been tested on `Debian 8`, `CentOS 7` and `Ubuntu 15.04`.

There are two builds: "development" and "production".  By default, `make` with no argumnets builds the production image. Here's how to build both:

```
make
make dev
```

**NOTE** the output of make command is usually a container image. For example `make dev` 
creates `$HOME/build/planet-dev.aci`

### Development Mode

Planet can run in "development mode" when a single container contains both 
Kubernetes master and Kubernetes node. This allows to launch a fully functional 
single-node "cluster" on your laptop:

```
make start-dev
```

You'll see how various services are starting and then it will stop. To play with this tiny "cluster" you'll need
to enter it (use another terminal session):

```
make enter
```

You're inside of a container now which runs all Kubernetes components, run `ps -e` and you'll see something like:

```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 ?        00:00:00 systemd
   61 ?        00:00:01 systemd-journal
   76 ?        00:00:00 systemd-logind
   79 ?        00:00:00 dbus-daemon
   82 ?        00:00:00 systemd-resolve
 1766 ?        00:00:00 kube-proxy
 2879 ?        00:00:00 bash
 4724 ?        00:00:00 kube-apiserver
 4725 ?        00:00:00 kube-scheduler
 4726 ?        00:00:00 kube-controller
```

### Production Mode

To start Planet on a real cloud in production mode you'll have to start Kubernetes-master and Kubernetes-node instances
separately. Here's how you do this for AWS (add more providers in the future).

First, create more than two AWS instances. You'll need one istance for Kubernetes master image, and one for each 
of Kubernets nodes.

Upload `$BUILD/planet-master.tar.gz` to the master AWS instance, untar it using `tar -xzf` and find `planet` executable
inside of `rootfs` directory of the image. Then you can start Planet and it will containerize itself:

```
./rootfs/usr/bin/planet --role=master --cloud-provider=aws \
        --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:<key-id> \
        --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:<key>
```

Similarly, upload & untar the planet-node image onto each AWS node instance and run:

```
.rootfs/usr/bin/planet --role=node \
    --master-ip=<master-ip> \
    --cloud-provider=aws \
    --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:<key-id> \
    --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:<key>
```

### Publishing your own Planet build

If you're hacking on Planet and have a new build, this is how to add it (as an Orbit package) into your local Orbit repository:

```bash
orbit import planet-dev.tar.gz planet/dev:0.0.1
```
Now when you have Planet in your local Orbit repo, you can push it to remote Orbit repository by running `orbit push`,
and install it onto any site with `orbit pull` as shown above.

`Planet` is no different than any other Orbit package. Consult [Orbit documentation](https://github.com/gravitational/orbit/blob/master/README.md) to learn more.
