# This is a helper script, to wipe proxy related env variables when running etcdctl, which will cause etcdctl to
# try and use a customer provided http proxy.
# TODO(knisbet) The current build of etcd doesn't support NO_PROXY in CIDR format, once it does, this wrapper is
# no longer needed. Requires etcd release built with golang 1.12 or later: 
# https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Makefile#L54
